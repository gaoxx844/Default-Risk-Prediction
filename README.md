# Defealt-Risk-Prediction

The clients for this project include product managers, risk managers, marketers, and account supervisors. 
All have an interest in the project outcomes because the ability to predict credit default or repayment ability 
impacts business decisions in all of these areas. 

For example, a key Home Credit product is point of sale (POS) loans at retail locations . "POS loans are offered to 
finance purchases of consumer goods (such as mobile phones, home appliances and personal computers) by individuals 
at the physical “point of sale” either in the retailer’s store at the time of purchase, or online at the time of purchase ..." 

To offer this product Home Credit partners with retailers ("accounts"). These relationships are vital to Home Credit's business. 
Both Home Credit and the retailers care about the experience customers have inside stores when applying for a POS loan. 
Rejecting applicants (especially ones who are able to repay) may result in a negative experience that reflects on both the retailer 
and Home Credit. Home Credit's account supervisors worry about how this kind of outcome may impact the company's relationships with 
its retail partners. 

Another point of concern (especially for product and risk managers) revolves around customers who truly are a default risk. 
Extending loans and credit to people who cannot repay damages the overall Home Credit business and goes against the company's mission 
of responsible lending and financial inclusivity for underserved ("unbanked") people. 

In the end, everyone on the client team will want to understand both the credibility of your predictions ("why should we believe this?") 
as well as the implications ("what does it mean for our business?") 

Therefore, based on the information we have for each applicant, will this person be able to repay the loan on time? Try out classification
prediction using the data we have.
